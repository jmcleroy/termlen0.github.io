I"<p>This post shows you how to write a custom inventory plugin for Ansible. As usual, this is not a deep dive. If you are interested about what inventory plugins are or why you might want to use them. Please see <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory.html">the Ansible docs</a>. Additionally for an in-depth understanding of inventories in general and inventory plugins in particular I highly recommend these videos:</p>

<p>Finally, this post describes <em>my</em> workflow while building custom inventory plugins. This post is better consumed as a “do-it-along”.</p>
