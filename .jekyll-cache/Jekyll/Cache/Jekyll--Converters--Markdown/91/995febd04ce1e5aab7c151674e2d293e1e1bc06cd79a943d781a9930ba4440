I"‹<p>When it comes to automation role models, network engineers have often looked up,
to our compute brethren. For decades, compute admins have had tools that allowed
them to execute scripts on systems at particular times: typically backups,
rsync etc. More recently, in the VM universe,  DevOps tools like Chef/Puppet/
Ansible, have empowered â€˜Developer Administratorsâ€™, to stand up the entire app
stack, automatically.</p>

<p>In my network automation journey, I realized early on that, a big gap/obstacle
for network automation is the need for a backend, to track positive
integers; a source of truth, that knows what numeric value was last</p>
