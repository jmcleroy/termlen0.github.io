I"à<p>After being used to OSX Keychains in my old mac, I wanted a similar
functionality on my Linux laptop. Being prompted each time to login,
while interacting with <a href="https://github.com">github</a> for instance was
annoying. Searching the web, led me to
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store">git-credential-store</a>.
I was not too happy with the fact that credentials would be stored in
clear text, locally, indefinitely. I came across this stackoverflow
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-skip-password-typing-when-using-https-on-github/18362082#18362082">post</a> that
I adapted for Linux. The concept is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use a .netrc file to store your credentials. This follows the
file format for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.2.0/com.ibm.zvm.v620.kijl0/netrcd.htm#netrcd">netrc</a></li>
  <li>Encrypt this file,
using <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a></li>
</ol>
