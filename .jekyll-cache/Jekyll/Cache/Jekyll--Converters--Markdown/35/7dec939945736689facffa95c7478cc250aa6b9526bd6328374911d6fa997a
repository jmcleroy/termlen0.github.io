  Hey there! I'm Ajay Chenampara and I am a Senior Solution Architect at Red Hat. 
</p>

<p>I have been doing network
administration/engineering/design/architecture for a few years now
(started right after college in 2000). For the last few years, I have
been focused on trying to “smarten” how we do networks.</p>

<p>Fortunately at my job, I am able to purse network automation full time
and also help spread the message and help fellow network engineers
around the world.</p>

<p>###Some other things about me</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not a fan of acronym FUD induced by: “SDN”, “SDWAN”, “NFV”, “VNF” etc (How on earth is WAN not the network!)</li>
  <li>I ride motorcycles, am a huge fan of science fiction and like listening to Vinyl</li>
</ul>

<p>###Some ways to get a hold of me</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
