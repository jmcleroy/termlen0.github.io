I"U<p>In itâ€™s most basic form, TDD works as follows:</p>

<pre><code>1. Envision the outcome of what you are developing [ Adding a VLAN
   to a switch ]
2. Write a test to validate that outcome [ Is the desired VLAN on
   the switch ]
3. Run the playbook, to invoke the test [ it will fail - RED test
   ]
4. Refactor your code [ write the roles/tasks needed for the tests
   to pass ]
5. Re-run tests [role] to ensure that they now pass
</code></pre>

<p>In this post, I hope to share my observations on how I used ansible to
implement this using roles. I start with known facts/assumptions:</p>
