I"´<p>This post is a consequence of an interesting conversation around
declarative control systems with a colleague. Throughout the
conversation, we kept coming back to the â€˜popularityâ€™ of automation
and specifically, how revolutionary, it appears for legacy, closed
systems(aka 80% of network gear in enterprises). When you think about it,
in a traditional control system (a bread toaster, in itâ€™s simplest
form), we interact with the system as follows:</p>

<pre><code>1. We tell it (declare) what our desired outcome is (how brown do you
want your toast)
2. Inputs (the slices of bread)
</code></pre>

<p>The system then figures out how to achieve your end state. In other
words..</p>
