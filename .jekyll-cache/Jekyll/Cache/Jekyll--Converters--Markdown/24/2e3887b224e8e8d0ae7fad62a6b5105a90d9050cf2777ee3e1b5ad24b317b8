I" <p>Last week I deployed my first “at scale” playbook. The overall objective was simple: Add new dhcp helper address to about 400 switches.
Like most things though, the devil is in the details. Right off the bat, I ran into “non-ansible” related issues (tacacs/ssh).
That brought the number of devices to about 270. Not a big number right?
At the most basic level, yes, if I was simply pushing configs using the ios_config
module.
##Breakdown of the playbook</p>
<ol>
  <li>Execute a show run on the device and compile a local backup for each device</li>
  <li>Run a pre-flight report, specific to the interfaces we are going to impact (multiple ssh sessions per host)</li>
  <li>Build the configs locally</li>
  <li>Deploy the configs</li>
  <li>Validate the configs/Unit testing</li>
</ol>
