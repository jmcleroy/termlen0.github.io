    <p><em>&quot;Everybody automate everything, now!&quot;</em> - Enterprise CTO (who just got back from a industry networking event)</p>

<p><em>&quot;I wish my management would help bring in some of this cool network automation stuff I am learning from my peers online&quot;</em> - Network engineer</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard these comments from numerous organizations; often from CTOs and engineers within the same organization. So if the topmost level of the management is laying down goals to automate &quot;everything&quot; and the engineers themselves are excited to make it happen, why is there a gap?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/middle_mgmt.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So are middle managers the problem? Across organizations, middle mangers could be senior network engineers who have advanced to a point where there is no technical growth path. They have become comfortable managing a team of network engineers and know how to hire network talent. The automation space is filled with technical jargon and buzzwords that are new (and therefore scary). Coming from a technical background fear of the unknown can be unnerving. </p>

        NETCONF Ain't YANG
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2017</span>

    <p>Obvious!</p>

<p>Recently I was working on  YANG device models, using NETCONF to
interact with the actual device (NXOS 7.0.3.I6.1). I was using
Cisco&#39;s
<a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x_chapter_010100.html">NX-OS Programmability Guide</a> for
the 7.x version. I have had previous experience working with
YANG and Cisco&#39;s NEDs through the tail-f/NSO product and was feeling
quite confident in my understanding of how YANG is being used for
modeling (Either a service or a device) and how NETCONF was one of the
protocols used to interact with the model. 
However, I was getting lost trying to navigate the NXOS&#39;s YANG model
over the NETCONF client. </p>

        OT - A quick post on using gpg to manage github in Linux
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2017</span>

    <p>After being used to OSX Keychains in my old mac, I wanted a similar
functionality on my Linux laptop. Being prompted each time to login,
while interacting with <a href="https://github.com">github</a> for instance was
annoying. Searching the web, led me to
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store">git-credential-store</a>.
I was not too happy with the fact that credentials would be stored in
clear text, locally, indefinitely. I came across this stackoverflow
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-skip-password-typing-when-using-https-on-github/18362082#18362082">post</a> that
I adapted for Linux. The concept is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a .netrc file to store your credentials. This follows the
  file format for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.2.0/com.ibm.zvm.v620.kijl0/netrcd.htm#netrcd">netrc</a></li>
<li>Encrypt this file,
  using <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a></li>
</ol>

        Test Driven Development (TDD) for networks,  using Ansible
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>

    <p>In it&#39;s most basic form, TDD works as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1. Envision the outcome of what you are developing [ Adding a VLAN
   to a switch ]
2. Write a test to validate that outcome [ Is the desired VLAN on
   the switch ]
3. Run the playbook, to invoke the test [ it will fail - RED test
   ]
4. Refactor your code [ write the roles/tasks needed for the tests
   to pass ]
5. Re-run tests [role] to ensure that they now pass
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this post, I hope to share my observations on how I used ansible to
implement this using roles. I start with known facts/assumptions:</p>

        Of state, idempotency, and CI/CD in the brownfield network

    <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2017</span>

    <p>This post is a consequence of an interesting conversation around
declarative control systems with a colleague. Throughout the
conversation, we kept coming back to the &#39;popularity&#39; of automation
and specifically, how revolutionary, it appears for legacy, closed
systems(aka 80% of network gear in enterprises). When you think about it,
in a traditional control system (a bread toaster, in it&#39;s simplest
form), we interact with the system as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>1. We tell it (declare) what our desired outcome is (how brown do you
want your toast)
2. Inputs (the slices of bread)
</code></pre></div>
<p>The system then figures out how to achieve your end state. In other
words..</p>
